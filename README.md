Advanced Programming in C

Labs taken in Fall 2017

Lab 1 (Division Test): A guessing game and will tell you if you guessed the number correctly or not.

Lab 2 (Waiting List): A restaurant waiting list that is implemented with 2 arrays and an integer counter.

Lab 3 (Waiting List Structs): Modification of Lab 2; use an array of structures instead of static arrays.

Lab 4 (People List): Keep track of a list of people through the implementation of a union.

Lab 5 (Waiting List Nodes): Modification of Lab 3; use a linked list instead of an array of structures.

Lab 6 (Waiting List Node Range): Continuation of Lab 5; be able to prioritize people according to group size and implement an array of linked lists.

Lab 7 (Waiting List Files): Extension of Lab 6; input several people upon initialization of the program with a text file as an argument.

Lab 8 (Waiting List Binary Recursion): Continuation of Lab 7; read and write using a binary file and reverse the linked lists using recursion.

Lab 9 (Waiting List Makefile): Extension of Lab 8; use a makefile to help in the compilation process.

Lab 10 (Waiting List Threads): Modification of Lab 9; implement an auto-saver thread that saves the info from the people list to a text file every five seconds.

Final Project: Read and write to a binary file by implementing a key.
